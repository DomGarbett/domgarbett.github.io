After a long 11 hour flight from London Heathrow we arrived in Bogotá, Colombia at around 3:40 am local time. With a spoilt night of sleep on the plane and adjusting to the 5 hours time zone change we decided to wait in the airport until dusk to attempt to catch a taxi to our hostel.

Whilst we were unable to check in to our rooms until 3pm we decided to leave our bags with the hostel locked store and head over to Monserrate hill.  Monseratte hill is the highest point in Bogota with views all across the city. The queues to get onto the funicular to the top and the cable car back down were definitely worth the views.

At the top there is a church which is of particular importance to pilgrims. As it was a Sunday it was even more busy than usual.

At the top of the hill there was also various food stalls in a market setting, we decided to try out some local cuisine by trying a Colombian dish called Ajiaco. A chicken, potato and coriander soup is probably the best way of describing this dish , served with rice and avocado.
