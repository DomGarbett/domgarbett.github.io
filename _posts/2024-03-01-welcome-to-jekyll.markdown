On saturday 9th March we'll be flying out to bogota colombia, to begin a 12 week adventure of latin america.

The rough plan looks something like this

- Fly into bogota, colombia
- visit some coffee plantations in salento / manizales
- checkout Medell√≠n
- Head to peru
- Find somewhere cool to explore during easter semanta santa (holy week)
- explore amazonian basin
- head to cuzco + do the salkantay trail to macchu piccu
- go to bolivia and explore the salt flats at la paz
- transit back to colombia and go checkout the carribean coast up north
- Fly back to london via bogota

During the trip I'll be attempting to keep this blog up to date with pictures and a daily check in which will sit [here](/location)
